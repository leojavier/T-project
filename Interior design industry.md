**The ASID State of the Industry** report explores design as a business, from education and practice to specification and legislation. The report provides a unique overview of the design industry, including its size, scope and financial impact.

Did you know: Designer revenues were just under `$7.3 billion` in 2011, with an estimated `12,100 interior design firms`. With an additional `$1 billion` in earnings by the `17,100 self-employed designers` and `$1 billion` from `architecture firms’ interior design services`, the total revenue of interior design businesses was over **$9 billion.**

the ASID projects a growth rate of 13% through 2022, a forecast that bodes well for home furnishings. Laura Horsley, ASID’s vice president of marketing and communications, told Home Accents Today that interior designers “definitely have a strong impact on the home accents industry,” with firms specifying an estimated $46.3 billion in products each year. ASID’s 2014 Industry Outlook put average product sales at 60% of a design firm’s total revenue.
